# SDSU-Eats
561-Data and Web development

I propose developing a campus food ordering platform called "SDSUEats." that can make it easier for college students to order food on campus. Right now, students often have to wait in long lines to order food, but with SDSUEats, they can order from any campus food stall using a single website. This means they won't have to wait in line, and all the food stalls on campus will be available on the website. It's like a one-stop-shop for ordering food without the hassle of waiting in line. Key features of this website include:

    

1)Main Menu: Our website includes all the food stalls available on campus. Students can browse the menu and order from any stall.
2)Order notifications: Once an order is placed, students will receive real-time notifications, including an estimated preparation time. They will be alerted 5 minutes before their food is ready, eliminating the need to wait in line.
3)Payment Options: Students will have the choice to pay at the stall when picking up their orders or to use various debit/credit card payment methods.
4)Promotions and Discounts: The website can offer promotions, discounts to encourage students to explore different stalls and try new cuisines.
