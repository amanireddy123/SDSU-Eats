                <h2>Order food with ease!</h2>
                <p>This project was designed for EE561: Database and Web Development taught by Professor Ugur Dogan. This is an interactive website that
                    can make it easier for college students to order food on campus. Right now, students often have to wait in long lines to order food, 
                    but with SDSUEats, they can order from any campus food stall using a single website. This means they won't have to wait in line, and 
                    all the food stalls on campus will be available on the website. It's like a one-stop-shop for ordering food without the hassle of 
                    waiting in line. </p>
