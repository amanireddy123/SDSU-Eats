To run the webpages in this branch, clone this branch and open the folder in VSCode. You can navigate to other webpages after executing the Home.html code. It is necessary to have all the .css, .js and .html files to be in the same folder before executing them or else the page would the necessary styles. At the moment there is not much functionality to the webpages, it is just a basic layout of how I would want the webpages to be. Other enhancements would eventually be added in a timely manner.
